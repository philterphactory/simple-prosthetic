This is an experiment to produce the smallest possible / simplest possible
prosthetic for the www.weavrs.com platform. It may help those who are
intimidated by the django framework inside of the standard prosthetic-runner.

See

    http://developer.weavrs.com

for more information.


To make it do something,

* change prosthetic.py to do what you want it to do
* go into the admin to add a weavrs instance for i.e. www.weavrs.com
* add a prosthetic to a weavr on i.e. www.weavrs.com
* use the run option, which will queue a task which will run your prosthetic
